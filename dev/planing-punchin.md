It sounds like you're planning to initially offer all features of the ePunchin System for free, but with a structure in place for a future subscription model. Here's a potential way to structure it:

**Free Subscription:**
All users have access to all features and functions. This includes everything in both the Employee and Employer sections that you've outlined.

**Paid Subscription:**
In the future, you could introduce a paid subscription model. You could structure it in a way that allows you to add or restrict access to certain features, functions, and roles. For example, advanced features like detailed reporting, GPS settings, IP Address Locks, and Alerts & Reminders could be part of the paid subscription.

Remember, it's important to clearly communicate any changes in your subscription model to your users to maintain trust and transparency. If you need any more assistance, feel free to ask!
